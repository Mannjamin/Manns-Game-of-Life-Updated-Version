This version utilises the same backend processing as the original with added features. 

## Improvements Over the Original Version:
* The Ability to Change Cell Array Colors.
* Toggle Between Square and Cirlce Cells.
* Improve Statistical Data Gathering and Displayment.
* Implement an ability to change the size of cells.
* Improved Graphical User Interface.
* Added Slider to Change Cell Generation Processing

## Development
I developed this version of my original Game of Life over the weekend before the second year of my Bachelors Degree began.
I built an updated version utilising a much wider understanding of GUI production within Java using Java Swing.
This improved knowledge of mine is also visble in other works such as my Flight Time Calculator.
